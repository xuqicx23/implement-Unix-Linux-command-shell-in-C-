# implement-Unix-Linux-command-shell-in-C-
Use C++ implement a standard Unix/Linux command shell. The shell has builtin functions like "cd", the shell creates a directory stack and have the command of "push" "pop" and display the stack. Additionally, this shell can run standard Unix tools like emacs. In the end, I provide environment variable to the shell. If user forget the path of one program, the shell can search the whole path in the system and execute the program

In the related materials, builtin.h lists all the builtin functions parse.h list the parse function used for parsing the command line read from the user myShell.cpp gives the clearly structure of the basic Unix/Linux shell
